Q1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
Ans. HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.
     Communication between client computers and web servers is done by sending HTTP Requests and receiving HTTP responses.
	
	HTTP Request or Response:
	1. Browser (Client) sends a HTTP request to the web.
	2. Web server receives the request.
	3. Server runs an application to process the request.
	4. Server returns an HTTP response to the browser.
	5. Browser (Client) receives the response.


			HTTP 1.1																HTTP 2
1. It requests resourse inlining for getting multiple pages.							1. It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
2. It works on textual format.												2. It works on binary protocol.
3. It compresses data by itself.												3. It uses HPACK for data compression.
4. There is head of line blocking all the requests behind until it doesn't get all the resources.	4. It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.

Q2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
Ans. 	Objects are important data types in javascript. Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.).
	Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair.
	These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods in the context of an object.

	Every object has some property associated with some value. These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them.

	var myBike = new Object();

	myBike.make = 'Suzuki';

	myBike.model = 'Burgman Street 125';

	myBike.year = 2018;

	myBike.wheels = 2;

	After creating myBike object, the value inside the object can be accessed using keys. i.e.,

		myBike.year

		Output: 2018

	These values can be accessed using brackets notation also.

		myBike[year]

		Output: 2018
